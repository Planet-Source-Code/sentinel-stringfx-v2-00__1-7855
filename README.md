### Description

(PLEASE ALSO LOOK AT VERSION 2.10!)This code is an example of 13 different FX that can be easily implemented to a string. I have put them all together and put in quite a few notes explaining what each FX is doing. As you can see from the screenshot each effect can be modified in certain ways. I have written this so that you can have a better understanding of how computers work. I have tried to avoid using many of the built in functions. Each FX may not be the most efficient way of doing them, but I have done it this way to highlight the internal workings. All FX (apart from Rotate) work at a character at a time. Please send in any comments you may have - Good or Bad - so I can improve on it further. If you have any questions then email me. PLEASE RATE THIS. Thankyou.
